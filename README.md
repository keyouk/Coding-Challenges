Coding Challenges


# The Challenge


Each Coding Challenge will be first solved by any means necessary (including brute force), and then solved as if it was a large scale problem. Every problem will be done in Python (known as a slower language) to increase my skills of optimizing code. There is an understanding that there is a right tool for the right job in terms of programming languages, however regardless each challenge will be an attempt to be solved using Python.
