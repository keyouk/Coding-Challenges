Coding Challenges

# Introduction


The purpose of this repository is to store coding challenges that I have done in order to:

> <sub>1. Keep as a reference for future issues.

> <sub>2. Keep as a "Portfolio" to show recruiters how I code and how much I practice.

> <sub>3. Use as motivation to continuously build this repository.

> <sub>4. Practice my coding skills.

> <sub>5. Hopefully have others improve my code and do code reviews.

This repository is kept primarily and ultimately to help me learn as a developer and keep track of my progress.

# The Challenge


Each Coding Challenge will be first solved by any means necessary (including brute force), and then solved as if it was a large scale problem. Every problem will be done in Python (known as a slower language) to increase my skills of optimizing code. There is an understanding that there is a right tool for the right job in terms of programming languages, however regardless each challenge will be an attempt to be solved using Python.
