Coding Challenges

# Introduction* * *


The purpose of this repository is to store coding challenges that I have done in order to:

> <sub>1. Keep as a reference for future issues.

> <sub>2. Keep as a "Portfolio" to show recruiters how I code and how much I practice.

> <sub>3. Use as motivation to continuously build this repository.

> <sub>4. Practice my coding skills.

> <sub>5. Hopefully have others improve my code and do code reviews.

This repository is kept primarily and ultimately to help me learn as a developer and keep track of my progress.
